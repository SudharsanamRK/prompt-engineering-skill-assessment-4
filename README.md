## 7. Answer Engineering

### Prompt:
Rewrite this answer to make it suitable for a beginner audience:  
"Transformers use self-attention mechanisms to process input sequences simultaneously instead of sequentially like RNNs."

### Output:
"Transformers are a type of AI that look at all parts of the input at once, rather than step by step like older methods. This helps them understand the whole picture faster."
